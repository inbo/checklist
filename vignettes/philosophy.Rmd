Everybody develops its own coding habits and style.
Some people take a lot of effort in making their source code [readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming#Readability_of_source_code), while others don't bother at all.
Working together with different people is easier when everyone uses the same standard.
The `checklist` package defines a set of standards and provides tools to validate whether your project or R package adheres to these standards.
You can run these tools interactively on your machine.
You can also add these checks as [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions), which runs them automatically after every [push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push) to the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com).

## Coding style

The most visible part of a coding style is the naming convention.
People use many different styles of naming conventions within the R ecosystem [@Baath2012].
Popular ones are `alllowercase`, `period.separated`, `underscore_separated`, `lowerCamelCase` and `UpperCamelCase`.
We picked `underscore_separated` because that is the naming covention of the [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org) packages.
It is also the default setting in the [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr/blob/master/README.md) package which we use to do the [static code analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis).

At first this seems a lot to memorise.
RStudio makes things easier when you activate all diagnostic options (_Tools_ > _Global options_ > _Code_ > _Diagnostics_).
This highlights several problems by showing a squiggly line and/or a warning icon at the line number.
Instead of learning all the rules by heart, run `check_lintr()` regularly and fix any issues that come up.
Do this when working on every single project.
Doing so enforces you to consistently use the same coding style, making it easy to learn and use it.

### Rules for coding style

- `underscore_separated` names for functions, parameters and variables.
- A line of code or comments must be no longer than 80 characters.
  Pro tip: have RStudio display this margin in the editor.
  _Tools_ > _Global options_ > _Code_ > _Display_ > _Show margin_
- Object names must not be longer than 30 characters.
- Start a new line
    - after the pipe (`%>%`)
    - never before but always after `{`
    - before `}`
- Use spaces instead of tabs.
  Pro tip: make RStudio place 2 spaces when you hit the tab key.
  _Tools_ > _Global options_ > _Code_ > _Editing_ > _Insert spaces for tabs_
- Use spaces consistently
    - Use exactly one space before and after
        - assignments `<-`, `->`, `=`
        - operators like `+`, `-`,`*`, `/`, ...
    - No space before and one space after `,`
    - One space before `(` except in `function(` (don't use `function (`)
    - One space between `)` and `{`
    - No space after or before `(` or `[`
- Use double quotes (`"`) to define character strings.
- No trailing whitespace
    - spaces at the end of a line
    - blank lines at the end of the script

### Static code analysis checks

- Is an object defined before you use it?
- Do you use an object after you defined it?
- Use `<-` or `->` to assign something.
  Only use `=` to pass arguments to a function (e.g. `check_package(fail = TRUE)`).
- Use `is.na(x)` instead of `x == NA`.
- Use `seq_len()` or `seq_along()` instead of `1:length(x)`, `1:nrow(x)`, ...
  Advantage: when `length(x) == 0`, `1:length(x)` yields `c(1, 0)`, whereas `seq_along(x)` would yield an empty vector.
- Don't store code in comments.
  If you don't want to loose code, use version control systems like [`git`](https://git-scm.com/).
- Avoid code with lots of nested loop or if statements.
  If the code is too complex, you'll get a warning that the [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) is too high.
  Tips for reducing the code complexity:
    - Use `assertthat::assert_that()` to validate object or conditions instead of `if() stop()`.
    - See if you can use `ifelse()` instead of `if()`.
    - Split the main function of your code over a few sub functions.

## File name conventions

To make this easier to remember we choose the same name conventions for file names as for objects.
We acknowledge that these rules sometimes clash with requirements from other sources (e.g. `DESCRIPTION` in an R package, `README.md` on GitHub, `.gitignore` for git, ...).
In such case we allow the file names as required by R, git or GitHub.
When `check_filename()` does unfairly not allow a certain file or folder name, then please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/inbo/checklist/issues) and motivate why this should be allowed.

### Rules for folder names

- Folder names should only contain lower case letters, numbers and underscore (`_`).
- They can start with a single dot (`.`).

### Rules for file names

- Base names should only contain lower case letters, numbers and underscore (`_`).
- File extensions should only contains lower case letters and numbers.
  Exceptions: file extensions related to R must have an upper case R (`.R`, `.Rmd`, `.Rd`, `.Rnw`, `.Rproj`).

### Rules for graphical file names

- Applies to files with extensions `csl`, `eps`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `pdf`, `png` and `ps`.
- Same rules except that you need to use a dash (`-`) as separator instead of an underscore (`_`).
  We need this exception because underscores cause problems in certain situations.

## Bundling your code in a package

Most users think of an R package as a collection of generic functions that they can use to run their analysis.
However, an R package is a useful way to bundle and document a standalone analysis too!
Suppose you want to pass your code to a collaborator or your future self who is working on a different computer.
If you have a project folder with a bunch of files, people will need to get to know your project structure, find out what scripts to run and which dependencies they need.
Unless you documented everything well they (including your future self!) will have a hard time figuring out how things work.

Having the analysis as a package _and_ running `check_package()` to ensure a minimal quality standard, makes things a lot easier for the user.
Agreed, it will take more time to create the analysis, especially with the first few projects.
In the long run you save time due to a better quality of your code.

### Benefits

- The package itself is a way to cite (a specific version of) the analysis in a report or paper.
- You have to list all dependencies on other R packages.
  This makes installing your code as simple as running `remotes::install_github("inbo/packagename")`.
- You must split your analysis in a set of functions.
  Say goodbye to scripts with thousands lines of code.
- Functions make it easy to re-use code.
  Need to run the same thing with a different parameter value?
  Add the parameter as an argument to the function and run the function once for every different parameter value.
  This avoids the need to copy-paste large chunks of scripts and replace a few values.
  The copy-paste work flow typically results in hard-to-read long scripts.
  Imagine you made a mistake in the code and copy-pasted that mistake several times before you found it.
  You have to check your entire project to fix the mistake several times.
  Having it as a function reduces the workload to fixing only the function.
- Packages require that every object is either defined within the package or imported from another package.
  Global variables are not allowed.
  This ensures that the functions inside your package work with only the objects defined inside the package.
  They are not masked by objects defined by the user.
  Something that can happen in standalone scripts.
- A package gives the opportunity to add documentation to your code.
  Afterwards you can simply consult this documentation rather than having to dig into your code to find out what it is actually doing.
  Every function needs at least a title and an entry for every argument.
- Most likely you would still need a short script that combines a few high level functions of your package to run the analysis.
  The `inst` folder is an ideal place to bundle such scripts within the package.
  You can also use it to store small (!) datasets or RMarkdown reports.
